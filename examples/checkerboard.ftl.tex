\
Max Black proposed this problem in his book
\textit{Critical Thinking} (1946).
%
It was later discussed by Martin Gardner in his
\textit{Scientific American} column, \textit{Mathematical Games}.
%
John McCarthy, one of the
founders of Artificial Intelligence described it as a
\textit{Tough Nut for Proof Procedures}
and discussed fully automatic or interactive proofs of the solution.

There have been several formalization of the Checkerboard problem before. A
survey article by Manfred Kerber and Martin Pollet called {\emph{A Tough Nut
for Mathematical Knowledge Management}} list a couple of formalizations.

% TODO
%\Naproche{} is based on weakly typed first order logic and basic set theory.
%We introduce types (``notions'') and constants to model checkerboards
%as a Cartesian product of ranks $1, 2, \ldots, 8$ and files $\fileA, \fileB, \ldots, \fileH$.

We introduce \textit{types} (or \textit{notions}) and constants
to model checkerboards as a Cartesian product of
ranks $1, 2, \ldots, 8$ and files $\fileA, \fileB, \ldots, \fileH$.


\begin{forthel}
    \begin{signature} A rank is a notion. \end{signature}
    Let $r, s$ denote ranks.

    \begin{axiom} $r$ is setsized. \end{axiom}

    \begin{signature} $1$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $2$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $3$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $4$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $5$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $6$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $7$ is a rank. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $8$ is a rank. \end{signature}

    \begin{definition} $\Rank = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$. \end{definition}

    \begin{signature} A file is a notion. \end{signature}
    Let f, g denote files.

    \begin{axiom} f is setsized. \end{axiom}

    \begin{signature} $\fileA$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileB$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileC$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileD$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileE$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileF$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileG$ is a file. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $\fileH$ is a file. \end{signature}

    \begin{definition}
        $\File = \{\fileA,\fileB,\fileC,\fileD,\fileE,\fileF,\fileG,\fileH\}$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{signature} A square is a notion. \end{signature}
    \begin{axiom} $(f, r)$ is a square. \end{axiom}
    Let $v, w, x, y, z$ denote squares.

    \begin{definition}
        $\Checkerboard$ is the class of squares $x$ such that $x = (f, r)$ for some
        element $f$ of $\File$ and some element $r$ of $\Rank$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{axiom} $\Checkerboard$ is a set. \end{axiom}
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Preliminaries about sets and functions}

We enrich the small built-in set theory by further properties and axioms that
will be used in the course of our argument. To keep the document fully
self-contained we formulate the necessary definitions and axioms ourselves.
Note that there are many degrees of freedom in picking an axiomatic setting.

\begin{forthel}
    Let $A,B,C$ denote sets.

    \begin{definition}
        A subset of $B$ is a set $A$ such that
        every element of $A$ is an element of $B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{axiom}[Extensionality]
        If $A$ is a subset of $B$ and
        $B$ is a subset of $A$ then $A = B$.
    \end{axiom}

    \begin{definition}
        A proper subset of $B$ is a subset $A$ of $B$ such that $A\neq B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        $A$ is disjoint from $B$ iff there is no element of $A$ that is an element of $B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        Assume that every element of $C$ is a set.
        $C$ is pairwise disjoint iff $A$ and $B$ are disjoint for all nonequal
        elements $A, B$ of $C$.
    \end{definition}


    \begin{definition}
        $B \cap C = \{ x \in B | x \in C\}$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        $B \setminus C = \{ x \in B | x \notin C\}$.
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}

Observe the notion \textit{object}:
this is the built-in \textit{largest notion}, containing all other notions.
%
Also note that the proof of the lemma below really is omitted and not merely hidden:
with the help of automated theorem provers such as \textsf{E}\,\cite{eprover}, \Naproche{}
can accept some theorems without any additional argumentation.


\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        Every set is an object.
    \end{lemma}
\end{forthel}

The built-in ordered pair {notation} that we already used in the first
subsection does not include the universal property of ordered pairs,
so we postulated it as an axiom.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{axiom}
        Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ be objects.
        If $(\alpha, \beta) = (\gamma, \delta)$
        then $\alpha = \gamma$ and $\beta = \delta$.
    \end{axiom}
\end{forthel}

(Unary) functions are built into \Naproche{}; $F(t)$ denotes the
application of a function $F$ to an argument $t$ and
$\dom(F)$ stands for the domain of $F$. In our exposition we shall
use functions to compare cardinalities of black and white squares. As with
sets, we introduce some further properties of functions.

\begin{forthel}
    Let $F,G$ denote functions.

    \begin{definition}
        $F : A \to B$ iff $\dom(F) = A$ and
        $F(x)$ is an element of $B$ for all elements $x$ of $A$.
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}

Bijective functions are the basis of the modern theory of cardinalities; sets
have the same cardinality iff there is a bijection between them.

\begin{forthel}
    % TODO remove parentheses of quantifiers.
    \begin{definition}
        $F : A \leftrightarrow B$ iff $F : A \to B$ and there exists $G$ such that
        $G : B \to A$ and
        (for all elements $x$ of $A$ we have $G(F(x)) = x$) and
        (for all elements $y$ of $B$ we have $F(G(y)) = y$).
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Cardinalities of Finite Sets}

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
        $A$ is equinumerous with $B$ iff there is $F$ such that $F : A \leftrightarrow B$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        Assume that A is equinumerous with B. Then B is equinumerous with A.
    \end{lemma}

    % TODO prettify proof (try to allow for subscripts in variables?)
    % Use symbolic quantifiers to avoid uncanny valley of parenthesized natural language text?
    %
    \begin{lemma}
        Assume that A is equinumerous with B and B is equinumerous with C.
        Then A is equinumerous with C.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Take a function $F$ such that $F : A \leftrightarrow B$.
        Take a function $G$ such that $G : B \to A$ and (for all elements $x$ of $A$ we have $G(F(x)) = x$) and
        (for all elements $y$ of $B$ we have $F(G(y))=y$).
        Take a function $H$ such that $H : B \leftrightarrow C$.
        Take a function $I$ such that $I : C \to B$ and (for all elements $x$ of $B$ we have $I(H(x)) = x$) and
        (for all elements $y$ of $C$ we have $H(I(y))=y$).
        Define $J(x) = H(F(x))$ for $x$ in $A$.
        $J : A \leftrightarrow C$. Indeed define $K(y) = G(I(y))$ for $y$ in $C$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}


For the finite checkerboard problem we only need to consider finite sets.
Intuitively we can thus assume that all sets considered are finite, and then
we have the following finiteness axiom:

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{axiom}
        If $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ then $A$ is not equinumerous with $B$.
    \end{axiom}
\end{forthel}


\subsection{The Mutilated Checkerboard}

In this subsection we define the mutilated checkerboard and dominoes consisting
of two adjacent squares.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
        $\Corners = \{ (\fileA, 1), (\fileH, 8) \}$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        $\Mutilated = \Checkerboard \setminus \Corners$.
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}



\subsection{Dominoes}

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{signature}
        $r$ is vertically adjacent to $s$ is a relation.
    \end{signature}
    Let $r\vertadj s$ stand for $r$ is vertically adjacent to $s$.

    \begin{axiom}
        If $r\vertadj s$ then $s\vertadj r$.
    \end{axiom}
    \begin{axiom}
        $1\vertadj 2\vertadj 3\vertadj 4\vertadj 5\vertadj 6\vertadj 7\vertadj 8$.
    \end{axiom}

    %\begin{axiom} $1\vertadj 2$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $2\vertadj 3$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $3\vertadj 4$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $4\vertadj 5$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $5\vertadj 6$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $6\vertadj 7$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $7\vertadj 8$. \end{axiom}

    \begin{signature}
        $f$ is horizontally adjacent to $g$ is a relation.
    \end{signature}
    Let $f\horizadj g$ stand for $f$ is horizontally adjacent to $g$.

    \begin{axiom}
        If $f$ is horizontally adjacent to $g$ then $g$ is horizontally adjacent to $f$.
    \end{axiom}
    \begin{axiom}
        $\fileA \horizadj \fileB \horizadj \fileC \horizadj \fileD
        \horizadj \fileE \horizadj \fileF \horizadj \fileG \horizadj \fileH$.
    \end{axiom}

    %\begin{axiom} $\fileA \horizadj \fileB$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileB \horizadj \fileC$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileC \horizadj \fileD$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileD \horizadj \fileE$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileE \horizadj \fileF$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileF \horizadj \fileG$. \end{axiom}
    %\begin{axiom} $\fileG \horizadj \fileH$. \end{axiom}


    % TODO REGRESSION: we're getting an ambiguity error
    % with the direct bracketing of the nested existential.
    % This does not change the -T output.
    \begin{definition}
        $x$ is adjacent to $y$ iff
        %there exist sets $f, r, g, s$ such that
        there exists a file $f$ such that
        there exists a rank $r$ such that
        there exists a file $g$ such that
        there exists a rank $s$ such that
        ($x=(f,r)$ and $y=(g,s)$) and (($f=g$ and $r$ is vertically adjacent to $s$) or
        ($r=s$ and $f$ is horizontally adjacent to $g$)).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        A domino is a set $D$ such that $D = {x,y}$ for some
        adjacent squares $x, y$.
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}



\subsection{Domino Tilings}

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
        A domino tiling is a pairwise disjoint class of dominoes.
    \end{definition}

    Let $A$ denote a subset of $\Checkerboard$.

    \begin{definition}
        A domino tiling of $A$ is a domino tiling $T$
        such that for every square $x$
        $x$ is an element of $A$ iff
        $x$ is an element of some element of $T$.
    \end{definition}
\end{forthel}

We shall prove:

\begin{theorem}
    There is no domino tiling of $\Mutilated$.
\end{theorem}



\subsection{Colours}

We shall solve the mutilated checkerboard problem by a cardinality argument.
Squares on an actual checkerboard are coloured black and white and we can count
colours on dominoes and on the mutilated checkerboard $\Mutilated$.

The introduction of colours can be viewed as a creative move typical of
mathematics: changing perspectives and introducing aspects that are not part
of the original problem. The mutilated checkerboard was first discussed under
a cognition-theoretic perspective: can one solve the problem {\emph{without}}
inventing new concepts and completely stay within the realm of squares,
subsets of the checkerboard and dominoes.


\begin{forthel}
    \begin{signature} $x$ is black is a relation. \end{signature}
    \begin{signature} $x$ is white is a relation. \end{signature}

    \begin{axiom} $x$ is black iff $x$ is not white. \end{axiom}
    \begin{axiom} If $x$ is adjacent to $y$ then $x$ is black iff $y$ is white. \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom} $(\fileA,1)$ is black. \end{axiom}
    \begin{axiom} $(\fileH,8)$ is black. \end{axiom}

    \begin{definition} $\Black$ is the class of black elements of $\Checkerboard$. \end{definition}
    \begin{definition} $\White$ is the class of white elements of $\Checkerboard$. \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma} $\Black$ is a set. \end{lemma}
    \begin{lemma} $\White$ is a set. \end{lemma}
\end{forthel}


\subsection{Counting Colours on Checkerboards}

The original checkerboard has an equal number of black and white squares.
Since our setup does not include numbers for counting, we rather work with
equinumerosity. The following argument formalizes that we can invert the
colours of a checkerboard by swapping the files $\fileA$ and $\fileB$, $\fileC$ and $\fileD$, etc..
We formalize swapping by a first-order function symbol $\Swap{}$.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{signature}
        Let $x$ be an element of $\Checkerboard$.
        $\Swap{x}$ is an element of $\Checkerboard$.
    \end{signature}

    Let $t$ denote an element of $\Rank$.

    \begin{axiom} $\Swap{(\fileA, t)} = (\fileB, t)$ and $\Swap{(\fileB, t)} = (\fileA, t)$. \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom} $\Swap{(\fileC, t)} = (\fileD, t)$ and $\Swap{(\fileD, t)} = (\fileC, t)$. \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom} $\Swap{(\fileE, t)} = (\fileF, t)$ and$\Swap{(\fileF, t)} = (\fileE, t)$. \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom} $\Swap{(\fileG, t)} = (\fileH, t)$ and $\Swap{(\fileH, t)} = (\fileG, t)$. \end{axiom}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $x$ be an element of $\Checkerboard$.
        $\Swap{x}$ is adjacent to $x$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Take $f$, $r$ such that $x = (f, r)$.
        $r$ is an element of $\Rank$.
        Case $f = \fileA$. End.
        Case $f = \fileB$. End.
        Case $f = \fileC$. End.
        Case $f = \fileD$. End.
        Case $f = \fileE$. End.
        Case $f = \fileF$. End.
        Case $f = \fileG$. End.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}

$\Swap{}$ is an involution:

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        Let $x$ be an element of $\Checkerboard$.
        $\Swap{(\Swap{x})} = x$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Take $f, r$ such that $x = (f,r)$. $r$ is an element of $\Rank$.
        Case $f = \fileA$. End.
        Case $f = \fileB$. End.
        Case $f = \fileC$. End.
        Case $f = \fileD$. End.
        Case $f = \fileE$. End.
        Case $f = \fileF$. End.
        Case $f = \fileG$. End.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $x$ be an element of $\Checkerboard$.
        $x$ is black iff $\Swap{x}$ is white.
    \end{lemma}
\end{forthel}

%From Swap we can define a map which testifies that:
Using $\Swap$ we can define a witness of $\Black \leftrightarrow \White$.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        $\Black$ is equinumerous with $\White$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Define $F(x) = \Swap{x}$ for $x$ in $\Black$.
        Define $G(x) = \Swap{x}$ for $x$ in $\White$.
        Then $F : \Black \to \White$ and $G : \White \to \Black$.
        For all elements $x$ of $\Black$ we have $G(F(x)) = x$.
        For all elements $x$ of $\White$ we have $F(G(x)) = x$.
        $F : \Black \leftrightarrow \White$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}

Given a domino tiling one can also swap the squares of each dominoes,
leading to similar properties.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{signature}
        Assume that $T$ is a domino tiling of $A$.
        Let $x$ be an element of $A$.
        $\Sw(T,A,x)$ is a square $y$ such that there is an element $D$ of $T$
        such that $D = {x,y}$.
    \end{signature}

    \begin{lemma}
        Assume that $T$ is a domino tiling of $A$.
        Let $x$ be an element of $A$.
        Then $\Sw(T,A,x)$ is an element of $A$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $y = \Sw(T,A,x)$.
        Take an element $D$ of $T$ such that $D = {x,y}$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}


Swapping dominoes is also an involution.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        Assume that $T$ is a domino tiling of $A$. Let $x$ be an element of $A$.
        Then $\Sw(T,A,\Sw(T,A,x)) = x$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $y = \Sw(T,A,x)$.
        Take an element $Y$ of $T$ such that $Y = {x,y}$.
        Let $z = \Sw(T,A,y)$.
        Take an element $Z$ of $T$ such that $Z = {y,z}$.
        Then $x = z$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Assume that $T$ is a domino tiling of $A$.
        Let $x$ be a black element of $A$.
        Then $\Sw(T,A,x)$ is white.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $y = \Sw(T,A,x)$.
        Take an element $Y$ of $T$ such that $Y = {x,y}$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}

\subsection{The Theorem}

\noindent We can easily show that a domino tiling involves as many black as white squares.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        Let $T$ be a domino tiling of $A$. Then $A \cap \Black$ is
        equinumerous with $A \cap \White$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Define $F(x) = \Sw(T,A,x)$ for $x$ in $A \cap \Black$.
        Define $G(x) = \Sw(T,A,x)$ for $x$ in $A \cap \White$.
        Then $F: A \cap \Black \to A \cap \White$ and
        $G: A \cap \White \to A \cap \Black$.
        For all elements $x$ of $A \cap \Black$ we have $G(F(x))=x$.
        For all elements $x$ of $A \cap \White$ we have $F(G(x))=x$.
        $F : A \cap \Black \leftrightarrow A \cap \White$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}

\noindent In mutilating the checkerboard, one only removes black squares

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
        $\Mutilated \cap \White = \White$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        $\Mutilated \cap \White$ is a subset of $\White$.
        $\White$ is a subset of $\Mutilated$.
        Proof.
            Let $x$ be an element of $\White$.
            $x \neq (\fileA, 1)$ and $x \neq (\fileH,8)$.
            Indeed $(\fileH, 8)$ is black.
        End.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}

\noindent Now the theorem follows by putting together the previous cardinality properties.
Note that the phrasing \textit{[...]\,has no domino tiling} in the theorem is automatically derived from the definition of \textit{a domino tiling of\,[...]}.

\begin{forthel}
    \begin{theorem}
        $\Mutilated$ has no domino tiling.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Proof by contradiction.
        Assume $T$ is a domino tiling of $\Mutilated$.
        $\Mutilated \cap \Black$ is equinumerous with $\Mutilated \cap \White$.
        $\Mutilated \cap \Black$ is equinumerous with $\White$.
        $\Mutilated \cap \Black$ is equinumerous with $\Black$.
        Contradiction. Indeed $\Mutilated \cap \Black$ is a proper subset of $\Black$.
    \end{proof}
\end{forthel}
