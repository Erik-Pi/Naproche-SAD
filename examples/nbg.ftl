# This module implements the von Neumann-Bernays-GÃ¶del set theory,
# a conservative extension of ZFC. Any lemma that can be proven in ZFC
# also can be proven in NBG, but unlike ZFC, NBG is finitely axiomatizable,
# that is, we can describe it without using schemata over arbitrary formulas.
# The axiom schema of class formation has been omitted in this presentation
# because it is built into the compiler.

# NBG is usually stated using two kinds of basic types: classes and sets.
# Since we want to write statements '2 is in Z' we split the concept of sets
# into two types: sets and setobjects where a set is a collection (of setobjects)
# and a setobject is an object which lives in a set. Thus every set is a setobject
# and one can exhibit a coercion from any type to setobject by assuming as an
# axiom that the class of all inhabitants of this type is a set.
